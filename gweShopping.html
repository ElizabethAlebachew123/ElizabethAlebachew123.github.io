  Brandy Melville has been in a lot of controversy for their 'one size fits all' clothing, where all their items are either a small or extra small. This is a huge issue because it leaves shoppers feeling insecure of their bodies. Brandy Melville's clothing can only be worn by certain groups of people and excludes many others. This is an example of an online shop affecting body image in a negative way, causing shoppers a lot of harm. Additionally, this is especially true when the clothing is popular and there is a limited size selection. Shoppers, including many young girls, will go through dangerouse measures in order to fit into their one size clothing. This can lead to skipping meals and health issues.

  This is a popular online shop with A lot of celebraties supporting them. An issue that pops up a lot is that the cloths where made for people with Hourglass bodies. This can be discouraging and can make people feel insecure with there bodies. The models on Fashion Nova have these Ideal "Perfect Hourglass" bodies With thigh gaps and a slim waist which excludes many groups of people and can be discouraging espacially because Fashio Nova is whats "in"right now. Alle Connell from the Revelist tried on popular Fashion Nova cloths and said,"If I tried this on as a younger woman, I would hate myself. I would think this was how clothing was meant to fit, and that my body was the problem." This is what a lot of young girls may be feeling as well.
