    This is Megan Rose Lane. She is a beauty blogger, entrepreneur, self-love and mental health advocate who talks about her struggles with confidence and body image after giving birth. By using her story and impowering images and videos she hopes to build confidence in other young women. Megan uses her platform to inform and support those who have gone through the same expieriences as her such as eating disorders and mental health issues. accourding to female naratives Megan said"I realise that this world of ego, comparison, shallow materialistic insufficiency is suffocating me and deep down I KNOW happiness cannot be bought, earned or worked toward. Happiness is not 10lbs from now, it's not when you get your dream job, or when you're prettier, richer or more popular. Happiness is NOW. So stop fearing what isn't real and decide to live fully in the moment, fully in love with who you are on a level that's so much deeper than your eyebrows, achievements or shoe collection."
