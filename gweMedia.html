  Whenever we scroll through Instagram we see these "perfect bodies". Impossibly curvy yet,
  impossibly slim and it makes us wonder why don't I look like them? It's hard not to feel
  this way when society has changed the way social media is used to portray ourselves.
   When we see Instagram being flooded with so called "influencers", it changes the way
    we see actual influencers. An influencer is a user with established credibility,
    large following, and endorsements. They are portrayed to be ideal, and when they're
    compared to someone on Instagram who wouldn't be defined as real, it can change the way a
    lot of people, especially young girls, feel about themselves and the world around them.
    In return, this can lead to people going to extreme measures, physically and mentally,
    just to reach the level of satisfaction they "need" from society.
