  This is a popular online shop with A lot of celebraties supporting them. An issue that pops up a lot is that the cloths where made for people with Hourglass bodies. This can be discouraging and can make people feel insecure with there bodies. The models on Fashion Nova have these Ideal "Perfect Hourglass" bodies With thigh gaps and a slim waist which excludes many groups of people and can be discouraging espacially because Fashio Nova is whats "in"right now. Alle Connell from the Revelist tried on popular Fashion Nova cloths and said,"If I tried this on as a younger woman, I would hate myself. I would think this was how clothing was meant to fit, and that my body was the problem." This is what a lot of young girls may be feeling as well.

  Brandy Melville has been in a lot fire for it's "one size fits all" clothes. All there clothes are either small or extra small. This is a huge issue because shoppers will feel outcasted because of there body. The clothes are ment for certain groups of people and excludes many people. This is an example of an online shop affecting body image in a negative way and can cause people to look at their own bodies and feel bad because the clothes weren't made for many people. Especially when the clothes are very popular and there isn't much of a size selection. Poeple  will go to dangerouse measures to fit the one size clothes like skipping meals which can lead to health issues.
