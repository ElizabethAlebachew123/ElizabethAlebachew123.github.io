  First of all, what is body image? Body image is the subjective picture or mental image of one's own body.

    This is Ashley Graham. She is a well-known model in the industry for those who classify as curvy models. She is not afraid of calling out various modeling industries who exclude certain groups of people and has been an inspiration for many young girls. Also, she is a large advocate for body features, such as stretch marks, to become more normalized in our society. In 2016, she starred on the cover of the famous swimwear magazine, Sports Illustrated, in hope that the cover would inspire other women to love their own body, no matter what shape or size. Furthermore, Ashley says that,"I think there are too many women who are self-conscious about the way they look, the way they see themselves in the mirror. I hope that this cover is a testament to them, proving to them that they are beautiful no matter what."

    This is Megan Rose Lane. She is a beauty blogger, entrepreneur, and mental health advocate who shares her struggles with confidence and body image after she gave birth. By telling her empowering stories through social media, she hopes to build confidence in other young women. Megan uses her platforms to inform and support those who have gone through the same experiences, such as eating disorders and mental health issues. Megan says that, "I realise that this world of ego, comparison, shallow materialistic insufficiency is suffocating me and deep down I KNOW happiness cannot be bought, earned or worked toward. Happiness is not 10lbs from now, it's not when you get your dream job, or when you're prettier, richer or more popular. Happiness is NOW. So stop fearing what isn't real and decide to live fully in the moment, fully in love with who you are on a level that's so much deeper than your eyebrows, achievements or shoe collection." We LOVE that and we encourage you to go followe her for more empowering quotes!
