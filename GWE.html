  First of all, what is body image? Body image is the subjective picture or mental image of one's own body.

She is a well-known model in the industry for<br>those who classify as curvy models. She is not afraid of calling out<br>various modeling industries who exclude certain groups of people and has<br>been an inspiration for many young girls. Also, she is a large advocate for<br>body features, such as stretch marks, to become more normalized in our<br>society. In 2016, she starred on the cover of the famous swimwear magazine,<br>Sports Illustrated, in hope that the cover would inspire other women to love<br>their own body, no matter what shape or size. Furthermore, Ashley says that,<br>"I think there are too many women who are self-conscious about the way<br>they look, the way they see themselves in the mirror. I hope that this cover is<br>a testament to them, proving to them that they are beautiful no matter what."

She is a beauty blogger, entrepreneur, and mental<br>health advocate who shares her struggles with confidence and body image after<br>she gave birth. By telling her empowering stories through social media, she hopes<br>to build confidence in other young women. Megan uses her platforms to inform<br>and support those who have gone through the same experiences, such as eating<br>disorders and mental health issues. Megan says that, "I realise that this world of<br>ego, comparison, shallow materialistic insufficiency is suffocating me and deep<br>down I KNOW happiness cannot be bought, earned or worked toward. Happiness<br>is not 10lbs from now, it's not when you get your dream job, or when you're prettier,<br>richer or more popular. Happiness is NOW. So stop fearing what isn't real and decide<br>to live fully in the moment, fully in love with who you are on a level that's so much<br>deeper than your eyebrows, achievements or shoe collection." We LOVE that and we<br>encourage you to go followe her for more empowering quotes!
